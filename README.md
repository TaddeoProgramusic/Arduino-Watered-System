# Arduino-Watered-System

This project uses an analog soil moisture sensor to detect the humidity level of the soil and display the result using three LEDs of different colors. It is designed to run on an Arduino UNO and does **not** require any external libraries.

## Requirements

- 3 LEDs of different colors  
- 3 × 220Ω resistors (one for each LED)  
- 1 analog soil moisture sensor  
- 1 Arduino UNO board  
- 1 breadboard  
- Jumper wires  
- No additional libraries are needed for the code  

## Description

The soil moisture sensor outputs an analog value that represents how wet or dry the soil is. The Arduino reads this value and activates one of the LEDs depending on the moisture level. This provides a simple visual indication of soil conditions.

You can use this project as a base for automated irrigation systems, plant monitoring setups, or environmental sensing experiments.
